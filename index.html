        <h2> Who We are</h2>
        <p>JTFS aims at helping school-age children, who have the desire to acquire formal education, but,  who due to
        poverty cannot by themselves attain such heights. JTFS, targets African kids in sub-saharan Africa countries.
        This part of the world is often termed the "poverty headquarters of the world".
        Although this might seem like an exaggeration, research has shown that indeed, kids from that part of the world are
        really disadvantaged. <br> Upon extensive research, it has been discovered that most of these kids
        have genuine desire to attend school and become great people in life. If the desire is there, there has to be a way to actualize such dreams for these wonderful kids.
        <br> This is where JTFS Foundation aim to help this kids actualize their dreams by providing them school materials that parents cannot afford and that are usually the
        reason they do not go to school. Ironically, it does not require a lot to help these kids. </p>
